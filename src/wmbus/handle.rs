//! # Wireless M-Bus (wM-Bus) Handle
//!
//! This module provides the WMBusHandle struct, which represents a handle to the
//! wireless M-Bus (wM-Bus) connection. It is responsible for managing the
//! wireless connection, including connecting, disconnecting, sending frames,
//! and receiving frames.
